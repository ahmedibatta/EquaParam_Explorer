# EquaParam-Explorer

Working with large models containing hundreds of parameters and equations can be challenging, especially when trying to identify all related and dependent equations.

I developed EquaParam to streamline this process. The tool takes a text file containing equations and an Excel file detailing parameters and their meanings. With EquaParam, you can easily search for parameters or variables within the equations, understand the significance of each parameter, and identify all equations that include a specific parameter. This facilitates efficient changes and modifications to the model.
