# EquaParam-Explorer

Working with large models that encompass hundreds of parameters and equations can often be a daunting task. The challenge intensifies when one attempts to pinpoint all related and dependent equations within such complex structures.

To address this challenge, I developed EquaParam-Explorer. This tool is designed to streamline the process of managing extensive models. It operates by taking a text file filled with equations, alongside an Excel file that details parameters and their respective meanings. With EquaParam-Explorer, users gain the ability to effortlessly search for specific parameters or variables within the equations. They can also comprehend the significance of each parameter and pinpoint every equation that incorporates a given parameter. This functionality significantly enhances the efficiency of making changes and modifications to the model.

## Inputs 
- Text file containing equations.
- Excel file listing parameters and their meanings.
- Search entry: Users can search for an exact or partial name of a parameter or variable.

## Output
The output includes the selected parameter or variable, its meaning, and all equations containing this parameter or variable. 
This comprehensive display facilitates a deeper understanding and more effective manipulation and changes of the model.
